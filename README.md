# Embedded Robot for Path Navigation and Intelligent Parking | Course Project

* Built an Arduino-based autonomous robot using IR sensors for line tracking, obstacle avoidance, and parking.
* Modeled control logic in Heptagon, compiled to C, and integrated with Arduino for deterministic execution.
* Implemented a PID controller for motor control, ensuring smooth path correction and stable navigation.
